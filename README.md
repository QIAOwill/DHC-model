## DHC Model Introduction
To address the challenge of predicting intercity mobility flows during holidays, this paper proposes a model named the `Dynamic Time-Space Holiday Feature Captor` (**DHC**), 
as shown in the following figure. The model comprises four primary modules: the Vision Dynamic Extension module (**VDE**), 
the Spatiotemporal Feature Acquisition module (**SFA**), the Vision Feature Extraction module (**VFE**), and the Holiday Feature Fusion module (**HFF**).
